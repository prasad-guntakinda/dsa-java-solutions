This repo contains solutions for all DSA problems using java

As all the files are single-source-code files we can directly run it without compiling.

####  Single-file-source-code program example:
I have a file called `HelloWorld.java`  now I can run it using `java HelloWorld.java`

#### How to execute with a package?

```shell
# goto dsa-java-solutions directory
$> cd dsa-java-solutions

# execute with package name
$dsa-java-solutions>  java arrays\twopointer\IsValidPalindrome.java

```
